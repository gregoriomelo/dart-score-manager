- When running unit tests, run them without watching for file changes.
- When running e2e tests, prefer headless mode.
- Before finishing a task, always do builds, lint and run the tests.
- Before finishing a task, check if the tests can be improved in terms of human readability as well as functional coverage
- Run e2e tests when you're refactoring.

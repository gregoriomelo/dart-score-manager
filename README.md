## How to Play

### Countdown Mode
1. **Setup**: Enter player names (2-8 players) and select starting score (301, 501, 701, 1001)
2. **Gameplay**: Current player enters their score for each turn
3. **Scoring**: Scores are subtracted from the player's remaining total
4. **Winning**: First player to reach exactly 0 wins the game

### High-Low Challenge Mode
1. **Setup**: Enter player names and set starting lives (default: 5)
2. **Gameplay**: Players take turns throwing darts
3. **Challenges**: Set challenges for other players to beat
4. **Lives**: Players lose lives when they fail challenges
5. **Winning**: Last player with lives remaining wins

### General Features
- **History Tracking**: View individual player history (ðŸ“Š button) or consolidated game history
- **Game Management**: Use "Reset Game" to restart with same players, or "New Game" to start over
- **Auto-Save**: Game progress is automatically saved - refresh the page to continue where you left off

## Game Rules

- Players must score exactly their remaining points to win (countdown mode)
- Maximum score per turn is 180 (theoretical maximum in darts)
- Scores that would result in negative points are invalid
- Players take turns in the order they were added
- High-low mode uses a lives system with challenge mechanics
